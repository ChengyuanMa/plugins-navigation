jQuery Navigation Plugin
Two possible nav effects so far: 'fade' and 'slide' - added the default setting which has no effect
going to make a vertical menu as well as the horizontal menu I have already
Going to make the right side subitems fall to the left of the dropdown
Going to make a fixed width or 'auto' width option for the top level items
